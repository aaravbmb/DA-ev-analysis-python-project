# Data Analytics | Electric Vehicle Analysis with Python
A major project that utilises Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn to derive useful information for stakeholders from raw data. This project is a continuation of the completion of the course "Data Analytics with Python" offered by freeCodeCamp.org

## Executive Summary:
Using Python, Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries, I created various visualization that shows information about the manufacturers, models and location of various EVs and PHEVs to help stakeholders evaluate market decisions.

## Business Problem:
As EVs are gaining traction due to their low running costs and no emissions promise, people are switching over to EVs at a rapid pace in the area of Washington. We must determine the share of various EVs an PHEVs within the districts, determining average range as well as top models.

## Methodology:


## Skills:
- **Pandas**: A Python library used to manipulate data. It is used to read CSV files into a dataframe which is modified to remove outliers and make data clean.
- **MatPlotLib**: A data visualization library used to create bar graphs, pie charts and other types of visualizations to show trends, insights and correlation between values.

## Results & Business Recommendation:
