# Data Analytics | Electric Vehicle Analysis with Python
A major project that utilises Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn to derive useful information for stakeholders from raw data. This project is a continuation of the completion of the course "Data Analytics with Python" offered by freeCodeCamp.org

## Executive Summary:
Using Python, Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries, I created various visualization that shows information about the manufacturers, models and location of various EVs and PHEVs to help stakeholders evaluate market decisions.

## Business Problem:
As EVs are gaining traction due to their low running costs and no emissions promise, people are switching over to EVs at a rapid pace in the area of Washington. We must determine the share of various EVs an PHEVs within the districts, determining average range as well as top models.

## Methodology:
**1. Data Collection and Preparation:**
  - Imported raw EV and PHEV data in CSV format.
  - Utilized Pandas for cleaning the dataset, removing outliers, handling missing values, and preparing it for analysis.

**2. Data Analysis:**
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends in EV adoption by district.
  - Computed statistics such as average range, market share percentages, and frequency of top models.

**3. Data Visualization:**
  - Created bar graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present insights clearly and visually.

## Skills:
- **Pandas**: A Python library used to manipulate data. It is used to read CSV files into a dataframe which is modified to remove outliers and make data clean.
- **MatPlotLib**: A data visualization library used to create bar graphs, pie charts and other types of visualizations to show trends, insights and correlation between values.

## Results & Business Recommendation:
- **District-wise EV Market Share**: Identified the top districts with the highest EV penetration and the dominant manufacturers in each area.
- **Top Models Analysis**: Highlighted top-selling models based on popularity and performance metrics.
- **Average Range Insight**: Provided stakeholders with an overview of range expectations for different categories of EVs.
- **Manufacturer Insights**: Revealed leading manufacturers and their market shares, helping stakeholders align marketing and production strategies.

Recommendations for business:
1. Focus marketing efforts on districts with lower EV penetration to boost adoption.
2. Partner with top-performing manufacturers to align with consumer preferences.
3. Enhance the range of EVs to cater to districts where longer commutes are prevalent.

## Next Steps:
- Extending the analysis by finding datasets from locations outside of Washington.
- Connecting dataset to a data visualization model like **Tableau** and incorporating real-time insights.
- Performing predictive analysis to identify potential trends.
